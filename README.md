==============

Break down apps into small pieces, load dynamically.

Now it goes without header.

Post list can auto resize to fit the screen height. I can't understand what the #page bottom margin for, but keep it.

All tabs are clickable.

The menus in toolbar can open, but no action.

Only the "Action" button works, click it to open the embeded case app.
